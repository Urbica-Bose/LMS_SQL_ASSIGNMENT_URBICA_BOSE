# LMS_SQL_ASSIGNMENT_URBICA_BOSE
This project showcases a full‑cycle SQL exploration of an LMS (Learning Management System) schema using MySQL Workbench: we began by mapping table relationships, then wrote targeted queries to answer real business questions. We identified course–category links, counted courses per category, and listed student emails via simple joins; drilled into course structures by pulling ordered modules and their content; calculated metrics such as average scores per assessment, top‑scoring submissions (leveraging window functions), and course‑level averages through multi‑table joins; produced operational reports like enrollments‑per‑user, May 2023 enrollment extracts, and assessments‑per‑course; surfaced data‑quality insights by flagging modules without content and courses without enrollments; and built performance dashboards—passing‑rate percentages, highest‑average assessments, and booking of assessments—using grouped aggregates, CASE logic, and LEFT JOINs to preserve zero‑activity rows. Throughout, we emphasized best practices: date‑range filtering instead of functions for index use, LEFT JOIN vs INNER JOIN to control result completeness, and clear ordering for hierarchical output. Together these queries form a reusable library that answers 20 + core analytics questions, illustrating relational‑model reasoning, aggregation, window‑function mastery, and query optimization—ready for immediate use or extension in any LMS analytics project.
